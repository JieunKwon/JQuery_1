JQuery practice 

1. What is  DOM?

        The browser knows how to display each node in the DOM and renders the web page by reading each node and drawing the appropriate pixels in the browser window. 
        JavaScript and jQuery enable you to interact directly with the DOM, reading each of the objects, changing those objects, and even removing and adding objects.
