JQuery practice 

1. What is  DOM?

        - The browser knows how to display each node in the DOM and renders the web page by reading each node 
        and drawing the appropriate pixels in the browser window. 
        
        JavaScript and jQuery enable to interact directly with the DOM, 
        reading each of the objects, changing those objects, and even removing and adding objects.

2. Javascript and JQuery

        - JavaScript and jQuery are by far the most common form of client-side scripting.

        - JavaScript has a built-in interpreter that can parse and execute the language. 
        That means that you can write complex applications that have direct access to the browser and the DOM.
        Access to the DOM means that you can add, modify, or remove elements from a web page without reloading it. 
        Access to the browser gives you access to events such as mouse movements and clicks. 

        - jQuery is a library that is built on JavaScript. 
        jQuery simplifies a lot of the JavaScript code into simple-to-use functionality. 
        jQuery provides a rich set of built in functionality that makes it easy to do a lot more with a lot less code.
